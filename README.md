# N Body

## A physics simulation

- This project is a simulation of the famous N body problem from physics and astronomy. This project is capable of simulating the motion of an arbitary number of planets with different masses and sizes.
- This project can be for anyone. It can be used as an astronomical simulation, or it can be used just for fun through playing around with many planets.
- This project is of interest to me because I am interested in physics and astronomy, and this is a perfect combonation of those two.

## User stories
- I wish to be able to add and remove planets of different masses to NBodySimulation
- I wish to be able to view the planets I have added to NBodySimulation
- I wish to be able to change and set G, the gravitational constant
- I wish to be able to run ticks and view the changing position of the planets
