# Three Body

## A physics simulation

- This project is a simulation of the famous three body problem from physics and astronomy. This project is capable of simulating the motion and collision of an arbitary number of planets with different masses and sizes.
- This project can be for anyone. It can be used as an astronomical simulation, or it can be used just for fun thorough playing around with many planets.
- This project is of interest to me because I am interested in physics and astronomy, and this is a perfect combonation of those two.
