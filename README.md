# Three Body

## A physics simulation

- This project is a simulation of the famous three body problem from physics and astronomy. This project is capable of simulating the motion and collision of an arbitary number of planets with different masses and sizes.
- This project can be for anyone. It can be used as an astronomical simulation, or it can be used just for fun thorough playing around with many planets.
- This project is of interest to me because I am interested in physics and astronomy, and this is a perfect combonation of those two.

## User stories
- I wish to be able to add planets of different masses to the simulation
- I wish to be able to view the planets I have added
- I wish to be able to change and set G, the gravitational constant
- I wish to be able to view the motion of the planets in the simulation
- I wish to be able to change the mass and position of added planets
