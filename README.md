# N Body

## A physics simulation

- This project is a simulation of the famous N body problem from physics and astronomy. This project is capable of simulating the motion of an arbitary number of planets with different masses and sizes.
- This project can be for anyone. It can be used as an astronomical simulation, or it can be used just for fun through playing around with many planets.
- This project is of interest to me because I am interested in physics and astronomy, and this is a perfect combonation of those two.

## User stories
- I wish to be able to add and remove an arbitrary number of planets to NBodySimulation
- I wish for these planets I add to be able to be added with different masses, positions, and velocities 
- I wish to be able to view the planets I have added to NBodySimulation
- I wish to be able to change and set G, the gravitational constant
- I wish to be able to run ticks that update the position of planets
- I wish to make the planets obey the laws of physics
- I wish to be able to not crash the program when inputting unexpected inputs (such as a string instead of an int or indexing outside an array)
- I wish for the program to tell me what what error I made when inputting an unexpected input
- I wish to be able to view ticks as they are running to see the changing positions of the planets
- I wish to be able to type "h" to view a list of commands that I can use
